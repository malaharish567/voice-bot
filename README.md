## AI-Voice-Bot

This project walks you through creating a real-time AI voice bot using Python, AssemblyAI, and ElevenLabs. The bot is designed to handle incoming calls, transcribe speech, generate intelligent responses, and provide a human-like conversational experience. Ideal for call centers, customer support, and virtual receptionist applications.
